      "*   **Objective:** Merged the best aspects of the various objective statements to create a comprehensive and impactful opening.\n",
      "*   **Skills:** Included all relevant skills identified by the agents, including specific security and compliance frameworks.\n",
      "*   **Experience:** Combined the most impactful language and quantifiable results from all agents, emphasizing security measures, compliance with regulations, and proactive risk management.\n",
      "*   **Projects:** Integrated security and compliance details from all agents into the project descriptions, highlighting proactive measures and quantifiable results.\n",

      "Review result: Feedback: The resume is very strong and well-tailored to the job description. Here are a few suggestions to further improve the relevancy score:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Quantify Security Improvements:** While the resume mentions security improvements, try to quantify them whenever possible. For example, instead of \"Implemented robust security measures,\" say \"Implemented robust security measures, reducing vulnerability scan findings by 30%.\"\n",
      "*   **Snowflake Specifics:** While SQL is mentioned, explicitly mentioning experience with Snowflake's specific security features (e.g., data masking, row-level security, network policies) would be a significant boost. If you have experience with these, add them to the skills section and incorporate them into the experience descriptions.\n",
      "*   **CIS Benchmarks:** Since the job description specifically mentions CIS benchmarks, ensure that the resume clearly highlights experience with implementing and auditing against these benchmarks. The PolicyRAG project does a good job of this, but consider adding it to other relevant experiences.\n",
      "*   **Trust and Risk Management:** The job description emphasizes trust and risk management. While the resume touches on these areas, consider using those exact phrases more frequently and explicitly connecting your experience to these concepts. For example, \"Contributed to the platform's trust posture by...\"\n",
      "*   **Developer Ecosystem:** The job description mentions supporting a robust developer ecosystem. If you have experience building APIs, SDKs, or tools for other developers, highlight this experience.\n",
      "*   **Compliance Certificates:** While you have certifications, consider adding any compliance-related certifications (e.g., CISSP, CISA, CISM) if you possess them.\n",
      "*   **Platform Focus:** Emphasize platform-level thinking and experience. Frame your contributions in terms of how they improved the overall platform's security, scalability, and reliability.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Objective:** While good, it could be *slightly* more specific to Snowflake's mission. Mentioning \"Data Cloud\" directly would strengthen it.\n",
      "*   **Skills:** Excellent coverage. Consider adding specific security certifications if Mihir has any (e.g., Security+, CISSP, CISA). Also, explicitly mentioning \"risk management\" and \"compliance\" in the skills section would be beneficial, even if already implied.\n",
      "*   **Experience:** This is the strongest section. The LTIMindtree experience is well-quantified and highlights relevant skills. Ensure the language used aligns with Snowflake's terminology (e.g., \"data platform\" instead of just \"system\").\n",
      "*   **Projects:** Very good. The projects demonstrate practical application of skills. Emphasize the security aspects of each project more explicitly. For example, in the Vehicle Loan Sales project, highlight the specific security measures implemented (e.g., encryption algorithms used, access control mechanisms).\n",
      "*   **Certifications:** Good to have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the resume is highly relevant. The suggested improvements aim to maximize the alignment with the job description's emphasis on security, governance, risk management, and compliance within the context of a cloud data platform.\n",
